#Tools You Will Need
1. Make sure Node and NPM installed on your computer. You can download both at nodejs.org (NPM is included in your Node installation)
2. Use a code editor of your choice. I am using and would personally recommend using VSCode. You can download VSCode at code.visualstudio.com.
3. Make sure you have Git installed on your computer. This is necessary for deploying our application with Heroku. You can get it at git-scm.com
4. An account at heroku.com. We will use Heroku to publish our app to the web entirely free.
